# Sisk web framework

This quickstart shows an example of how to have your Sisk server running in just a few steps. To start coding in your project:

```bash
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/sisk-http/quickstart

# run dotnet
cd quickstart
dotnet watch
```

And then you should see something like:

```
dotnet watch ðŸš€ Started
Service Sisk quickstart is listening at http://localhost:5555/
```

You'll need to have [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) installed in your machine.
